# Meditation App

The goal of this app is to support the user's meditation practice by sending daily reminder wisdom nuggets, tracking the consistency of their practice, and connecting them with community.

## User Stories

The user would receive a daily wisdom message from the teacher either through a notification or upon logging into the app.

- The user would set a timer for their mediations, no different than the timer already in your phone except this one would record the date/time and length of the meditation.

- The user would be able to look at a monthly calendar which has the days meditated marked out. At the top of the page there could be a total time meditated as well.

- The user would get a notification every 30 days of consecutive meditation. "You have completed the Nudgie challenge."

- The user would be able to see a list of community members who've meditated for any amount of days, ordered from most consecutive days meditated on down.

- The user should receive a notification when the bi-monthly Dharma Moon newsletter comes out.

- The user should be able to see a list (or a calendar) of Dharma Moon courses and events.

## Optional Stories:

`
-The user could watch videos recorded by David or other teachers giving basic - meditation instructions. Maybe some other video content as well.

- The user could share stories, thoughts, or experiences with other users in a user feed.

- The user could message other users within the app.
